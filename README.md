Implementation notes
====================

Permissions
-----------

Permission objects consists of three parts:

* Public: if the item is public to external viewers
* Groups: the viewer has to be member of one of these groups
* Users: the viewer has to be one of these users (not fully implemented, but
  simple to finish)

As soon as a permission object will be used client side, it is transformed to a
flat list of objects, where consisting of only `id` and `name`, the two fields
necessary for viewing or choosing. This makes handling a lot easier, and it
will never be a problem since the type is encoded in the id. The *public*
permission is hardcoded as a `p` in the `id` field.

This way of doing it is always up for discussion, but it seems flexible as soon
as it is worth the extra effort.

Dates
-----

The `Date` and `DateFromNow` component has to support input of three types: 

* null, for invalid data
* string, as is the case for server rendering
* moment object, as is the case for client rendering when server has rendered
  from string to moment first
